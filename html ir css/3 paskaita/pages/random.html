                <p> Bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour (usually wheat) and
                    water, usually by baking. Throughout recorded history and around the world, it has been an important
                    part of many cultures' diet. It is one of the oldest human-made foods, having been of significance
                    since the dawn of agriculture, and plays an essential role in both religious rituals and secular
                    culture.

                    <h3 id="about">Bread</h3>
                    <p> Bread is the staple food of the Middle East, Central Asia, North Africa, Europe, and in
                        European-derived cultures such as those in the Americas, Australia, and Southern Africa. This is
                        in contrast to parts of South and East Asia, where rice or noodles are the staple. Bread is
                        usually made from a wheat-flour dough that is cultured with yeast, allowed to rise, and finally
                        baked in an oven. The addition of yeast to the bread explains the air pockets commonly found in
                        bread. Owing to its high levels of gluten (which give the dough sponginess and elasticity),
                        common or bread wheat is the most common grain used for the preparation of bread, which makes
                        the largest single contribution to the world's food supply of any food.Sangak, an Iranian

                        Bread is also made from the flour of other wheat species (including spelt, emmer, einkorn and
                        kamut).[14] Non-wheat cereals including rye, barley, maize (corn), oats, sorghum, millet and
                        rice have been used to make bread, but, with the exception of rye, usually in combination with
                        wheat flour as they have less gluten.

                        Gluten-free breads are made using flours from a variety of ingredients such as almonds, rice,
                        sorghum, corn, legumes such as beans, and tubers such as cassava. Since these foods lack gluten,
                        dough made from them may not hold its shape as the loaves rise, and their crumb may be dense
                        with little aeration. Additives such as xanthan gum, guar gum, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose
                        (HPMC), corn starch, or eggs are used to compensate for the lack of gluten.

                    <h3>Culinary uses</h3>
                    Bread can be served at many temperatures; once baked, it can subsequently be toasted. It is most
                    commonly eaten with the hands, either by itself or as a carrier for other foods. Bread can be spread
                    with butter, dipped into liquids such as gravy, olive oil, or soup; it can be topped with various
                    sweet and savory spreads, or used to make sandwiches containing meats, cheeses, vegetables, and
                    condiments.Bread is used as an ingredient in other culinary preparations, such as the use of
                    breadcrumbs to provide crunchy crusts or thicken sauces; toasted cubes of bread, called croutons,
                    are used as a salad topping; seasoned bread is used as stuffing inside roasted turkey; sweet or
                    savoury bread puddings are made with bread and various liquids; egg and milk-soaked bread is fried
                    as French toast; and bread is used as a binding agent in sausages, meatballs and other ground meat
                    products. For more info press <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bread" target="_blank" class="noDecor"> here. </a>
